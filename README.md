This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Server Sent Events
Server sent events are used for one way communication from server to client. Server triggers an event on client whenever it recieves an update.
This can be used to sync client with a server on realtime basis.

## To run the demo
- Run `yarn install`
- Go to Demo directory in the repo
- Run server.js as node server `node server.js`
- Now, back to the root directory
- Run the project by `yarn run dev`
- Now open console window on the localhost:[`your Port, generay3000`]
- You will see logs every second till 10 seconds and then connection will close
